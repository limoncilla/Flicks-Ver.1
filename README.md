## Notes

I was commiting my files incorrectly so I lost all of them after I finished four parts of the video. But reaching out to my mentor was very helpful and she walked me through every step. Next time I'll be more careful about saving my work often.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I named the navigation identifier inconsistently so I received a lot of errors even though the build succeeded. Now I am feeling more confident about not worrying about erros too much and focus on researching ways to resolve them instead.
